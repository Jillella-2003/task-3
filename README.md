## ðŸ“‹ Description

This project is developed as part of **Task 3: Backend Integration and API Development** in the 45-Day Android Internship at **ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd.**

The goal of this task was to learn how to fetch and display data from a backend service using **REST APIs** in an Android app.

### âœ… What this app does:
- Connects to a public REST API: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
- Fetches a list of posts using **Retrofit**
- Displays the posts in a **RecyclerView**
- Handles success and error responses with **Toast messages**
- Follows good practices for code organization using Kotlin

### ðŸ’¡ What I learned:
- How to create and configure Retrofit for API calls
- How to define data models (`Post.kt`) for JSON responses
- How to use RecyclerView and ViewBinding to display dynamic lists
- How to handle API responses and failures gracefully

This task helped me understand the basics of **client-server interaction**, **network requests**, and **modern Android architecture**.
